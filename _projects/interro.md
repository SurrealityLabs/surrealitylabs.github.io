<b>What is it?</b>
The Interro is a set of quiz buzzers - a contestant lockout system, so that one of up to eight players can buzz in to answer a question, and everyone else is locked out until you reset the system. This way you know who answered first. There's also an auto-reset feature in case you forget to reset it.

<b>Where can I get the source code?</b>
Source code is available at our BitBucket repository, at <a href='http://code.surrealitylabs.com/interro'>http://code.surrealitylabs.com/interro</a>.

<b>Where can I get one?</b>
Right now, you can't - it's still in development. I'm hoping to offer kits soonish.

You can, however, build one of your own.

<b>How do I build my own?</b>
I'm working on a set of instructions and videos describing just that. Essentially, you'll need PCBs - I ordered mine from Seeedstudio - as well as stereo audio cables, a USB phone charger, some electronic components including an ATMEGA328P, and eight LED Night Lights.

<b>How does it work?</b>
I haven't written that up, yet - hopefully soon.
