Rudie “The Rude” Shahinian has been developing software professionally for the last 8 years. From the age of 5, his fascination with blinky-lights and ripping motors out of his toys led him down the path of Makerdom.  His activates in high school included build a computer into his car, making all the computers in the computer lab play C, G, or E in Qbasic, and automating the lights in his room to be controlled using voice recognition software accessed via a telephone.

 

The Rude’s latest projects include a Wheel of Fortune solver, Ouija board web app for using webkit, Game of Life JavaScript app. His other interested include laying guitar, watching TV and smashing things with flaming knives.
