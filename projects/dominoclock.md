<b>What is it?</b>
The Domino clock is my version of Carbon Design's <a href="http://www.carbondesign.com/repurposing-an-icon-introducing-carbons-domino-clock">Domino Clock</a>, except done with LEDs.

<b>How do I tell the time on this thing?</b>
The display area is divided up into three areas: hours, tens of minutes and minutes. The number of lit LEDs in each area tells the time, so 12 in the first area, 5 in the second, 2 in the third 12:52.

<b>Where can I get the source code?</b>
Source code is available at our BitBucket repository, at <a href='http://code.surrealitylabs.com/dominoclock'>http://code.surrealitylabs.com/dominoclock</a>.

<b>Where can I get one?</b>
You can't, yet - it's still in development.

You can, however, build one of your own.

<b>How do I build my own?</b>
No details yet, but the PCB layouts are in the source code repository, and the project basically requires an RTC module and an Arduino beyond that.

<b>How does it work?</b>
I haven't written that up, yet - hopefully soon.
