<b>What is it?</b>
The Word Clock is our version of the perennial favourite. It lights up different letters to form words that tell you what time it is.

<b>How do I tell the time on this thing?</b>
Just read the illuminated words!

<b>Where can I get the source code?</b>
Source code is available at our BitBucket repository, at <a href='http://code.surrealitylabs.com/wordclock'>http://code.surrealitylabs.com/wordclock</a>.

<b>Where can I get one?</b>
You can't, yet - it's still in development. We're working on Version 2 as a kit.

You can, however, build one of your own.

<b>How do I build my own?</b>
No details yet, but the PCB layouts are in the source code repository. I'll be doing some videos about assembly of this version.

<b>How does it work?</b>
I haven't written that up, yet - hopefully soon.
