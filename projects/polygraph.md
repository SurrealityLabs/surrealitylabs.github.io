<b>What is it?</b>
The Bluetooth Polygraph is our version of a polygraph, or "lie detector". It graphs various biofeedback responses - heart rate, skin conductivity, breathing - over time, along with an audio recording, so you can match what was said with the reaction. This is supposed to allow you - or a trained examiner - if the person is lying.

<b>Does it work?</b>
Ours polygraph is in no way certified, and at any rate isn't done yet. The real thing, according to the National Academy of Sciences in the US, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph#National_Academy_of_Sciences'>doesn't really work either</a>.

<b>Where can I get the source code?</b>
Source code will be available at our BitBucket repository soon.

<b>Where can I get one?</b>
You can't, yet - it's still in development.

<b>How do I build my own?</b>
No details yet.

<b>How does it work?</b>
I haven't written that up, yet - hopefully soon.
