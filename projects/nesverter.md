<b>What is it?</b>
The NESVerter is a small circuit board used to convert older video game controllers to USB. It's specifically designed for NES controllers, but can be adapted to other controllers as well.

<b>Where can I get the source code?</b>
Source code is available from <a href='http://code.surrealitylabs.com/nesverter/' target='_blank'>our BitBucket site.</a>

<b>Where can I get one?</b>
Right now, you can't, though we're looking at doing a kit version. You can, however, build your own.

<b>How do I build my own?</b>
You'll need to procure the circuit boards - the design files are included in the source on BitBucket - and buy the parts. It's a lot of surface mount soldering, so you'll need to understand how to do that. Some directions are available in the <a href="http://surrealitylabs.com/2013/06/nesverter/" title="NESVerter">description post.</a>

<b>How does it work?</b>
There's some information on this <a href="http://surrealitylabs.com/2013/06/nesverter/" title="NESVerter">here.</a>
