<b>What is it?</b>
The Project Vending Machine is a device that allows a user to copy information about a number of projects to a USB memory key. The user inserts a memory key to begin the process, selects a number of projects from a physical control panel, and hits a big red button to start the copy process. The machine then copies the project details to the USB key, so that the user can take the details home to build and tweak the projects to their heartsâ€™ content. The system uses a Chumby (actually an Insignia Infocast) as its base.
