We're applying to exhibit at Maker Faire Detroit 2012, in conjunction with our friends at <a href="http://www.usefulrobot.com/">Useful Robot</a> and <a href="http://www.inventorsplayground.com/">Inventor's Playground</a>. Some of the projects we're looking to show are:
<ul>
<li>Project Vending Machine 2, the updated version of last year's Editor's Choice Award-winning Project Vending Machine</li>
<li>Word Clock, our take on the ever-popular letter grid timepiece</li>
<li>SexyTime Watch, Useful Robot and Inventor's Playground's fun new wrist-mounted timepiece</li>
<li>The UN*X Clock, an open-source clock that shows the number of seconds since January 1, 1970</li>
<li>Easydimmer, Inventor's Playground's easy way to dim AC lamps</li>
<li>NESVerter, our NES-to-USB controller converter</li>
<li>Interro, our quiz game buzzer system</li>
<li>Useful Robot's Fencing Box</li>
<li>Inventor's Playground and Useful Robot's CircleClock<li>
<li>and, believe it or not, even more.</li>
</ul>
Watch this space for updates to our projects and to see what we've got coming up. It should be a good show (assuming we get in!)
