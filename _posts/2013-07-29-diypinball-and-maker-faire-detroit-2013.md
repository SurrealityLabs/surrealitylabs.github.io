We presented our latest project, <a href="http://diypinball.ca/">DIYPinball</a>, at Maker Faire Detroit this past weekend, along with collaborators <a href="http://www.inventorsplayground.com/" target="_blank">Inventor's Playground</a> and <a href="http://www.usefulrobot.com/" target="_blank">Useful Robot</a>. More details will be posted on <a href="http://diypinball.ca/">diypinball.ca</a> as they become available, but we had a great time and got a great response from a lot of pinball fans.
